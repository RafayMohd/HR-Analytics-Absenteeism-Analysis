Project Description:
This project leverages HR analytics to analyze absenteeism data within an organization. The dashboard provides insights into the average absenteeism rate, trends over time, and factors contributing to employee absenteeism. Key sections include:

Employee and Categories: Visualizes employee categories such as education, pets, children, and BMI, and correlates them with absenteeism rates.
Trends and Time: Displays absenteeism trends over months and days of the week, helping to identify patterns.
Reasons and Comparisons: Analyzes the reasons behind absenteeism and compares different categories, along with examining work-related expenses and their correlation with absenteeism.
The goal of this analysis is to provide actionable insights for HR departments to improve employee attendance and optimize operational efficiency.
